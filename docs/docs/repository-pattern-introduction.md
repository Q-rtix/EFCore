# Introduction to EFCore.RepositoryPattern

Welcome to the EFCore.RepositoryPattern documentation! This library provides a flexible and efficient solution for
implementing the repository pattern with Entity Framework Core (EF Core) in .NET applications. By leveraging the
repository pattern, developers can achieve cleaner and more maintainable code architectures while abstracting away the
complexities of data access.

## What is the Repository Pattern?

The repository pattern is a design pattern commonly used in software development to separate the logic that retrieves
data from a data source from the rest of the application's business logic. It acts as an intermediary layer between the
application's business logic and the data source (such as a database), providing a consistent interface for accessing
and managing data.

## Key Features of EFCore.RepositoryPattern:

1. **Abstraction of Data Access Logic:** EFCore.RepositoryPattern abstracts away the details of data access logic by
   providing generic repository interfaces and implementations. This allows developers to focus on writing
   application-specific logic without worrying about the intricacies of database operations.

2. **Modularity and Extensibility:** The library promotes modularity and extensibility by offering interfaces for
   repositories and units of work, allowing developers to easily swap out implementations or add custom logic as needed.

3. **Integration with Entity Framework Core:** Built on top of Entity Framework Core, EFCore.RepositoryPattern
   seamlessly integrates with EF Core's DbContext and DbSet functionalities, providing a familiar and efficient way to
   interact with databases.

4. **Transaction Management:** EFCore.RepositoryPattern includes transaction management capabilities, allowing
   developers to manage database transactions with ease, including support for save points.

5. **Async Support:** The library fully supports asynchronous database operations, enabling developers to build
   high-performance applications that can handle concurrent requests efficiently.

## Getting Started:

To start using EFCore.RepositoryPattern in your .NET applications, simply install the `EFCore.RepositoryPattern` package
via NuGet Package Manager. Once installed, you can begin using the provided repository
interfaces (`IRepository<TEntity>`) and unit of work interface (`IUnitOfWork`) to interact with your database in a
structured and modular manner.

Consult the [Getting Started](https://q-rtix.github.io/EFCore/docs/repository-pattern-getting-started.html) section for more details.
